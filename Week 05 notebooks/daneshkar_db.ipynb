        "A **Graph Database** is a type of database designed to store and manage relationships between entities in a graph-like structure. Unlike relational databases that use tables, graph databases use nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. This structure is ideal for scenarios that require capturing relationships and traversing them efficiently, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection systems.\n",
